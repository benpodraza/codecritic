# CodeCritic

**CodeCritic** is an agent-orchestrated code review framework designed to evaluate and improve Python/FastAPI code using AI-driven multi-agent collaboration.

It supports:
- Linting, formatting, and docstring improvements (FixAgent, DocAgent)
- Self-healing loops with test generation and validation (TestGenAgent)
- Structured experiment logging for research and reproducibility
- Human-in-the-loop feedback with SME scoring

### Goals

- Evaluate multi-agent code review pipelines in real-world codebases
- Support publishable research in AI-assisted engineering
- Generate production-grade code improvements via explainable agents

### Status

üöß MVP in development. Experiments conducted in notebooks, with structured logging and rollback.
